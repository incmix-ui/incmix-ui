The Incmix UI CLI can be used to generate typings for your custom theme tokens,
like colors, semantic tokens, component variants, etc.

The CLI scans your theme configuration and generates typings for your custom
tokens in the `node_modules/@incmix-ui/styled-system/dist/theming.types.d.ts`
file.

> **Troubleshoot:** If the theme typings don't show up immediately, try
> restarting your TypeScript server
> (`Cmd + Shift + P > "TypeScript: Restart TS server"` if you're using VSCode).

## Installation

In order to use the CLI, you need to install it as a dev dependency in your
project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @incmix-ui/cli
#or
yarn add --dev @incmix-ui/cli
```

To make it more convenient, it's also a good idea to create an npm script that
triggers it:

```json
// package.json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "theme": "incmix-cli tokens path/to/theme.ts",
    "theme:watch": "incmix-cli tokens path/to/theme.ts --watch",
  },
  ...
}
```

Don't forget to replace `path/to/theme.ts` with your theme file location.

## Usage

To generate typings for your theme, run the `theme` script:

```bash
npm run theme
# or
yarn theme
```

If you'd like to continuously generate theme typings as you're editing your
theme, run the `theme:watch` script:

```bash
npm run theme:watch
# or
yarn theme:watch
```

A successful execution should output something like this:

```sh
$ incmix-cli tokens src/theme/index.ts
