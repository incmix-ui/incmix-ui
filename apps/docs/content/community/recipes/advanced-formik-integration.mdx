Incmix UI can be coupled smoothly with [Formik](https://formik.org/), by the end
of the example up ahead, you will be proficient at Incmix & Formik.

In the `ImageRadio` component, we will utilize the `useRadio` hook from Incmix
UI to get the necessary props and the `isChecked` boolean. `isChecked` will be
used for validation in Formik's `useField` hook.

To finalize, we will need to render our content and pass `getInputProps` and
`getCheckedProps` from Incmix UI.

import {
  App as AppValidation,
  Index as IndexValidation,
  ImageRadio as ImageRadioValidation,
  RadioGroup as RadioGroupValidation,
  Input as InputValidation,
} from 'configs/sandpack-contents/advanced-formik-integration/image-radio-buttons'

<SandpackEmbed
  dependencies={{
    formik: '2.2.9',
  }}
  files={{
    '/App.tsx': AppValidation,
    '/index.tsx': IndexValidation,
    '/image-radio.tsx': ImageRadioValidation,
    '/radio-group.tsx': RadioGroupValidation,
    '/input.tsx': InputValidation,
  }}
/>

In the example above, there are 2 more components:

- `Radio Group` - which renders multiple radio buttons
- `Input` - where we will enter our value of choice

Upon submitting the form, in the CodeSandbox console, you should see the result
of which radio you've selected but also the value of the input.
