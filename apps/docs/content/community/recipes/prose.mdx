[Incmix UI Prose](https://github.com/nikolovlazar/incmix-ui-prose) is a
"second-party" package that adds ready-made styles to a remote HTML content.
It's "second-party" because it's created by one of Incmix UI's maintainers, but
it's not part of the core Incmix UI package just yet. The reason for that is to
avoid bloating the core library while we figure out how much people actually
need it. If there's a demand for it, it will be part of the core Incmix UI
package.

Incmix UI Prose is essentially a custom component that applies styles to its
children content.

Integrating the `Prose` component is fairly easy. To get started, you need to
install the package:

```bash
yarn add @nikolovlazar/incmix-ui-prose

# or

npm i @nikolovlazar/incmix-ui-prose
```

Then, you need to use the `withProse` theme extension to add the Prose component
styling into your own theme:

```typescript ln={2,8}
import { extendTheme } from '@incmix-ui/react'
import { withProse } from '@nikolovlazar/incmix-ui-prose'

const theme = extendTheme(
  {
    // your own theme
  },
  withProse(),
)

export default theme
```

To apply the styles to the remote HTML content, you just need to wrap it with
the `Prose` component:

```typescript
import { Prose } from '@nikolovlazar/incmix-ui-prose'

const MyPage = content => {
  return <Prose>{content}</Prose>
}

export default MyPage
```

If you want to override the default Prose style, you can do so by providing your
style overrides as an argument to the `withProse` extension:

```typescript
const theme = extendTheme(
  {},
  withProse({
    baseStyle: {
      h2: {
        fontWeight: 'light',
      },
    },
  }),
)
```

You can refer to the
[default theme](https://github.com/nikolovlazar/incmix-ui-prose/blob/main/packages/incmix-ui-prose/src/theme.ts#L17)
to understand how you can override a certain element style.

There's also a CodeSandbox available that uses the Incmix UI Prose package:

import { App, Index } from 'configs/sandpack-contents/prose/prose'

<SandpackEmbed
  dependencies={{
    '@nikolovlazar/incmix-ui-prose': '1.0.4',
  }}
  files={{
    '/App.tsx': App,
    '/index.tsx': Index,
  }}
/>
