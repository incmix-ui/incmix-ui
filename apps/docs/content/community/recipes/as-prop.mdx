title: The as prop and Custom component

By default, all Incmix components work with the `as` prop. There might be some
cases where you need to create smaller components with pre-defined styles, and
need the `as` prop to work as well.

For example, let's say you create a `Card` component with pre-defined styles
like this:

```tsx live=false
const Card = (props: BoxProps) => <Box px="4" py="5" rounded="sm" shadow="lg" {...props} />
```

and you need to consume this component in a way that works with the `as` prop,
like this:

```jsx live=false
const Usage = () => <Card as="button">This is a card</Card>
```

You might run into type errors like this:

```sh
Type '{ children: string; as: string; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & BoxProps'.
  Property 'as' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & BoxProps'.
```

To resolve this, you have 3 options

## Option 1: Using `forwardRef` from `@incmix-ui/react`

This is the recommended approach as it ensures your components forwards their
reference properly.

> Note ðŸš¨: You need to use forwardRef from incmix-ui not react.

```tsx live=false
import { forwardRef, Box, BoxProps } from '@incmix-ui/react'

const Card = forwardRef<BoxProps, 'div'>((props, ref) => <Box px="4" py="5" rounded="sm" shadow="lg" ref={ref} {...props} />)
```

## Option 2: Cast the component as a `IncmixComponent`

The `IncmixComponent` is a type we use internally to mark specific components as
Incmix components rather than using `React.PropsWithChildren`.

This is because a `IncmixComponent` gets its props from the React component or
element type, and adds incmix specific style props.

`IncmixComponent` takes 2 type generic, the element type (like "div", "button",
etc), and any custom props (like `isOpen`, `isDisabled`, etc)

```tsx live=false
import { IncmixComponent, Box, BoxProps } from '@incmix-ui/react'

type DivComponent = IncmixComponent<'div', {}>

const Card = ((props: BoxProps) => <Box px="4" py="5" rounded="sm" shadow="lg" {...props} />) as DivComponent
```

## Option 3: Use the `incmix` factory function

The Incmix factory function is still a work in progress but it can be useful in
this case as well. It can also be used to convert a non-incmix component into a
Incmix enabled component.

What you need to do is to call the `incmix` function and pass it any element or
component type.

```jsx live=false
import { incmix } from '@incmix-ui/react'

const Card = incmix('div', {
  // attach style props
  baseStyle: {
    px: '4',
    py: '5',
    rounded: 'sm',
    shadow: 'lg',
  },
})
```

These are the cases you can get the `as` prop working with custom components. At
least for now.
